## Tuning

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Learn why tuning is important
- Get familiar with different tuning strategies
- Know the advantages and disadvantages of the tuning strategies


### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following video  (sorry, rather low volume...):

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r random forest-quiz1, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements are true?",
  answer("Tuning means optimizing hyperparameters.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Doing tuning well is hard; nested resampling can help.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Good tuning is crucial to achieve good performance for all ML algorithms."),
  answer("Parallelization is trivial for tuning.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Tuning optimizes the inner loss.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("How well tuning works depends on the learner and the impact of the hyperparameters on that learner.", correct = TRUE)
)
```
