## Nested Resampling

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Learn why and how nested resampling works

### Preparation

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r tree-quiz2, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements about nested resampling are true?",
  answer("The result of nested resampling is just one value, the estimated generalization error.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Evaluating a linear model requires nested resampling."),
  answer("Nested resampling is super expensive.",correct = TRUE),
  answer("Choosing the correct resampling strategy is not as important as choosing the correct model.")
)
```
